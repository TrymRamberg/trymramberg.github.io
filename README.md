## Hey, I'm Trym!

I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science (with a minor in Business). I'm originally from Oslo, Norway, so if you ever have any questions about vikings, fjords, fishing, or how to build out a free health-care system, I'm sure I could be of service.

I'm currently a Web Developer for the Multidisciplinary Design Program (MDP) at the University of Michigan. I've been there for a little over two years now, and it's been a great experience working with so many talented and knowledgeable people. This upcoming summer, I will be joining the [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/) team as a Software Engineer Intern. 

I'm currently looking to join a research project. My interests lie mainly in computer systems and database management. I want to make computer systems and databases more secure.

When I'm not working at the library, I enjoy playing soccer, reading, running, and giving swedes a bad rep here in the US.

<!-- and raising awareness to unbeknownst americans on all the ways in which Norway is clearly better than Sweden. -->
