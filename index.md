**Hey, I'm Trym!**

I'm a junior at the University of Michigan studying Computer Science (with a minor in Business). I'm originally from Oslo, Norway, so if you ever happen to be in the area, give me a call and I could give you a tour!
<!-- ever have any questions about vikings, fjords, fishing, or how to get a universal health-care system, I'm sure I could be of service. -->

I'm currently a Web Developer for the [Multidisciplinary Design Program](https://mdp.engin.umich.edu/) (MDP) at the University of Michigan. 
<!-- I've been there for a little over two years now, and it's been a great experience working with so many talented people. -->
And this upcoming summer, I will be joining [Slalom](https://www.slalom.com/) as a Software Engineer Intern. 

I'm currently looking to join a research project. My research interests lie mainly in computer systems and database management. I want to make computer systems and databases more secure.

When I'm not studying away at the library, I enjoy playing soccer, reading, running, and of course giving swedes a bad rep here in the US.
